    "In supervised machine learning, one aims at learning a mapping $f_{\\psi} : \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{R}^P \\rightarrow \\mathbf{y}$ from observations $\\mathbf{x}$ to the target $\\mathbf{y}$ using a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{y}_i\\}_{i=1, \\dots, N}$ of finite size N (e.g. image classification, translation). Because of the curse of dimensionality, high-dimensional inputs (images) and complex the models (deep learning) require large datasets (million of pairs $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$). In practice, labelling data is expensive (e.g. marking the presence of cancer in X-ray chest scans). \n",

    "## Compression is Comprehension: Learning without Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality, we aim at learning a compressed representation $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{R}^M$ of $\\mathbf{x}$ such that $M < P$ and there is a mapping $g_{\\phi}: \\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{z}$ linking each data point to its representation. Ideally, $\\mathbf{z}$ is low-dimensional set of features which efficiently describes $\\mathbf{x}$. As an illustration, when modelling pictures of celebrities (CelebA dataset), the set of facial features (eye color, age, hair lenth, etc.) is a compressed (and lossy) representation of $\\mathbf{x}$. In practice, the representation  $\\mathbf{z}$ is unobservable and [unlikely to overlap with such known features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12359). Yet, the representation $\\mathbf{z}$ is low dimensional and learning a mapping $f_{\\psi} : \\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{R}^M \\rightarrow \\mathbf{y}$ is often easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas labelling the data is expensive, observations $\\mathbf{x}$ are cheap to acquire. In many cases, one can scrap the web to gather a large collection of images or text. As a result, large deep learning models can be deployed to learn $g_{\\phi}$, and smaller / data-efficient models can be applied downstream to solve the supervised task.\n",

    "# Auto-encoders: Compression as a Generation Process\n",
    "In this notebook you will implement a simple auto-encoder (AE). We assume that you are already familiar with the basics of neural networks. We will start by defining an AE similar to the one used for the finetuning step by [Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf). We will experiment with the AE setup and try to run it on the MNIST dataset. There has been a wide variety of research into the field of auto-encoders and the technique that you are about to learn is very simple compared to modern methods: Masked Autoencoders ([MADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509), [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) and Variational Autoencoders ([VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937), [BIVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02102), [NVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03898)).\n",

    "1. *Encoding* $\\mathbf{x}$ into a low-dimensional representation $\\mathbf{z}$ using a neural network $g_{\\phi} : \\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{z}$.\n",
