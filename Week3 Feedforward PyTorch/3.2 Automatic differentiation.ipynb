    "\n",
    "The `autograd` package provides automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors.\n",
    "It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be different.\n",

    "\n",
    "`torch.Tensor` is the central class of the package. Setting the attribute `.requires_grad` to `True` will make the tensor \"record\" all operations on it. When you finish your computation you can call `.backward()` and have all the gradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be accumulated into the `.grad` attribute.\n",

    "There’s one more class which is very important for autograd implementation - a `Function`.\n",

    "`Tensor` and `Function` are interconnected and build up an acyclic graph, that encodes a complete history of computation. Each tensor has a `.grad_fn` attribute that references a `Function` that has created the `Tensor` (except for Tensors created by the user - their `grad_fn` is `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compute the derivatives, you can call `.backward()` on a Tensor. If `Tensor` is a scalar (i.e. it holds a one element data), you don’t need to specify any arguments to backward(), however if it has more elements, you need to specify a `gradient` argument that is a tensor of matching shape."
